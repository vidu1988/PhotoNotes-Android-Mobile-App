# PhotoNotes-Android-Mobile-App
A note taking app that allows to take a photo and associate a caption for each picture. 
The list activity displays the list of saved notes. Each row is represented with a thumbnail picture plus a simple of piece of text (implemented using RecyclerView).
This app includes many modern day features like  voice note, geo-tagging, photo editing and shaking. It uses Google location, Google map, audio recording/playback, sensor and custom view.

Thanks!
